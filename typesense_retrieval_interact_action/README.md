JIVAS action for performing retrieval operations against the Typesense vector store, supporting retrieval-augmented generation tasks. As a core interact action, it plays a pivotal role in enhancing data retrieval processes and generating comprehensive results for queries. Configured as a singleton, it requires the Jivas library version 2.0.0 and depends on both `persona_interact_action` and `typesense_vector_store_action` for its functionality.

## How to Use

Below is detailed guidance on how to configure and use the Typesense Retrieval Interact Action.

### Overview

The Typesense Retrieval Interact Action provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the Typesense store. It supports multiple configurations for various use cases, including:

- **Custom retrieval tasks** for specific queries.
- **Integration** with Typesense vector stores.
- **Pipeline management** for chaining retrieval and generation tasks.

---

### Configuration Structure

The configuration consists of the following components:

### `vector_store_action`

Defines the vector store action label bound to this retrieval action.

```python
vector_store_action = "TypesenseVectorStoreAction"
```

---

### Example Configurations

### Basic Configuration for Typesense

```python
vector_store_action = "TypesenseVectorStoreAction"
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure the vector store action is properly configured and accessible.
- Test retrieval pipelines in a staging environment before production use.
